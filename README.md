# Digi-XDft
.NET wrappers for FT8 modulate and demodulate, including a sample program

This project contains the XDft.dll .NET assembly which wraps the FT8 encoder/decoder by Joe Taylor, K1JT. This assembly,
with some help reading/writing a sound card, can produce FT8 tones on a sound card, or decode received FT8 tones into text.
The "help reading/writing a sound card" is found in a submodule.
